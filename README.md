**WARNING! Works on this project are abandoned. Do not clone it, unless you're ready to finish it yourself. At this point it maybe pretty unusable at all!** For more information -- read [this blog post](http://onezeronull.com/2014/12/02/phonegap-audiobook-player-an-abandoned-project/).

Simple PhoneGap 2.9.0 file and folder picker demo. Written in pure [PhoneGap File API](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.9.0/cordova_file_file.md.html), with no extra visual frameworks used (like jQuery Mobile). It uses [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/icons/) and [Zepto.js](http://zeptojs.com/).

## Sources

Project is based on:

- [PhoneGap 2.9.0 File API](http://docs.phonegap.com/en/2.9.0/cordova_file_file.md.html),
- [File Chooser Dialog for PhoneGap Applications](http://ramkulkarni.com/blog/file-chooser-dialog-for-phonegap-application/).

## Tests

Tested on four different devices and Android versions:

- Samsung Galaxy Nexus with Android 4.3 (previously Android 4.2.2),
- LG GT540 with Android 2.3.3 and CyanogenMod, 
- GSmart Rola G1317D with Android 2.2.2,
- Sony Xperia E with Android 4.1.1.

All seems to be fine on all plaforms and all devices.

Tested **only** as compiled through [PhoneGap Build](http://build.phonegap.com). Never compiled locally or tested after such build.
